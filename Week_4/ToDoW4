Assignment #4

List of required functions:

1) getInput(prompt)
2) charToInt(digit)
3) doubledDigitValue(number)
4) sumOfDigits(cardNumber)
5) isValid(cardNumber)
6) getCardType(cardNumber)

Strategy:
You can and should build functions one by one
and test them in main. For example, to test getInput()
you might write in your main function:
   card = getInput("Enter card number:"):
   print(card) //should be whatever you enter

Once you are sure that function is working correctly,
you can delete (or comment out) those tests and start working
on the next function – testing it as you go. Once they are all written,
you can write the "real" main function…
it should only take a few lines of code to express.

Here is a diagram of how the functions should
relate to each other. It shows that main should
at some point call isValid and give it a string
like "43214368". isValid will do some work with
that string and eventually return true or false.
As part of doing its work, isValid should call
sumOfDigits and pass it the string representing
the card number. sumOfDigits will return an int
like 45 based on doing the Luhn algorithm.
sumOfDigits will in turn need to call carToInt
to convert '8' to the int 8 and doubleDigitValue
to take in 6 and return 3 since double of 6 is 12
but the sum of the digits is 3.























I'm looking between things. Between the states of seeing. Between all the ways we can perceive a moment,
from all the perspectives, in between there - there's magic and infinity in there.
