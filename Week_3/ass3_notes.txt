Write a program that will take
in the balance on a card, the amount someone
will pay each month assume constant payments),
and the APR on their card
(entered as a percent like: 19.9) - all three
values are possibly decimals.
It should print to a month by month summary
of their payoff schedule like this:

Enter balance: 1000                    
Enter payment: 150    
Enter APR: 19.9
   
Do not worry if columns do not line up perfectly,
but there should be a reasonable attempt to provide
some amount of formatting.

Assume that interest is calculated and added
to the previous month's balance before the
monthly payment is applied. Your output should
show enough lines to completely pay off the balance.
The balance should not go past 0. 

Hints:
Build your way to the final solution -
don't even worry about using APR/interest at first.
Monthly interest rate should be calculated as APR / 12.
Print out tab characters: '\t' to jump to the next column.
Don't worry if things do not line up perfectly.
(A large number will not fit in one tab worth of space).
You need to format the money to print to two decimals.
If you are not familiar with formatting output
then one method is to use this {:.2f} or you can look up other methods.
