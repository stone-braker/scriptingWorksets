Standard Deviation is a measure of how spread-out a group of numbers is.
It is signified by the greek letter sigma. \u03C3 in a string in python.
the Standard Deviation is defined as the square root of the variance. 
The Variance is: the avearage of the squared differnces from the mean.

To calculate Variance:
    -Work out the mean of the list of scores. (simple average of the #'s)
    -Then for each number, subtract the mean and square the result. (squared difference)
    -Then work out the average of those squared differences.
    -Then the standard deviation is the square root of the variance! easy.
